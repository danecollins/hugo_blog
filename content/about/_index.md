I wanted to give Hugo a try as a blog platform.  I was using Pelican but found it hard to understand how to make things look appealing. Hugo's themes solved that problem and allowed me to move my content easily enough. Once I was confident it would work I merged in the content that I had been keeping on WordPress. That was more work but I'm happy with the result.

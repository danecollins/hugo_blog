I have used the **Downcast** podcast player for years. It has several features that I like, and it does everything I want. With Spotify, Amazon and Apple all having their own podcast players, many with the ability to listen to podcasts without commercials I started thinking about looking and some of these options.

Given Apple's support of podcasts over time and their usual care in creating their apps I decided to try their podcast app first. That experiment did not last long.

## The Good

The Apple app is very geared towards podcast discovery which is great for new users. The app also has great graphics with great icons for podcasts.

Another benefit is the ability to subscribe to Apple radio shows. While you can play these shows in the Music app you cannot subscribe to them and have to browse through the app to find episodes. The podcast app lets you subscribe just like a podcast.


## The Bad

While the app has great visual qualities, there are several difficiencies, especially compared to what I am used to using.

While the graphics for each podcast are pretty, if you subscribe to a dozen or more podcasts they are clumsy to navigate. While the app shows you all the podcasts you are subscribed to it does not have a good way to see which one has new episodes. Each podcast tells you when it was refreshes but does not tell you how many episodes you have not listened to. Since I follow 25 podcasts I find this a fatal flaw.

While I like the idea of being able to subscribe to Apple radio shows I discovered that playing them through the podcast app lacks the best feature of playing them through the Music app, being able to see the artist and title of each song that is played.

In addition, the app does not let you set a playback speed per podcast so when you switch from a spoken podcast to a music one you have to manually reset the speed which is quite inconvenient.

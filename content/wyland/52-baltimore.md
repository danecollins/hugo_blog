### In Search of Wyland Walls

![Wildwood #43](../images/46-baltimore.webp)

Unlike the West coast, on the East coast, you cat get to three states between lunch and dinner.  After our success in Wilmington, we headed off to Baltimore to see “Extinct Atlantic Gray Whales” which while not an original Wyland, it has been repainted by someone else, it still retains most of the Wyland charm. It is in a great location across from the football stadium and I’m sure it is seen by a huge number of people as all Wyland wall should.

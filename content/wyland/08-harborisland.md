### In Search of Wyland Walls

![#83 Harbor Island](../images/83-sandiego.jpg)

When I first started researching _Race to Save the Ocean_ I actually put it into the extinct category because I figured a privately owned racing yacht is not something you could get access to, if it even still existed. I was wrong. While talking to my Dad I learned that not only did the yacht still exist, but that it was used as a charter boat sailing out of San Diego.

A quick call to Dennis Connor’s America’s Cup Experience revealed that indeed the Abracadabra sailed out of the San Diego Maritime Museum each day at 2pm. With my Dad having sailed in the San Diego bay frequently he knew exactly where to go to have a good view of the yacht as it went by. With some good timing, long lenses and a little patience we were able to a great view of the painting from Harbor Island.

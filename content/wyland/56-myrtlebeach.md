### In Search of Wyland Walls

![Wilmington DE](../images/49-myrtlebeach.webp)

This wall looked great as it has just been repainted, not by Wyland though. The person that did the work did a great job and added some personal touches such as pelicans in the middle of the wall. This was the largest wall we have seen on this trip and was a great way to finish our adventure.

### In Search of Wyland Walls

![Wildwood #43](../images/43-wildwood.webp)

After the disappointment of the destruction of “East Coast Humpbacks” in Philadelphia, we were doubly disappointed to find that “Humpbacks off the New Jersey Coast” was in the process of being painted over by someone. Especially as Wyland has been rejuvenating so many walls, to have someone else just painting over one of his walls was a little depressing.  Given the current state of the repainting, we probably only missed seeing it by a month or two. It reminds us that art is not forever. Don’t take it for granted and appreciate it each day you have it.

![Milwaukee #72](../images/72-milwaukee.jpg)

_Whale Commuters_ has quite the history in Milwaukee with many residents for it and many against it.  In the end, the wall it was on was demolished and just a small part of it was preserved and hung as a picture on the side of a freeway. Of all the walls we've visited this was the first time I could not figure out how to get a picture of us standing in front of the wall.

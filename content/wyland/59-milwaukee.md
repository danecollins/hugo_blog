![Milwaukee #72](../images/72-milwaukee.jpg)

_Whale Commuters_ has quite the history in Milwaukee . The original wall was on the rounded concrete facade of the former courthouse annex. Some residents loved the wall while others wondered what whales had to do with Milwaukee. The debate did not last long as the wall was destroyed less than 10 years later. A small part of the wall was preserved and hung as a picture on the side of a freeway. Of all the walls we've visited this was the first time I could not figure out how to get a picture of us standing in front of the wall.

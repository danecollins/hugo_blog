![Dallas #82](../images/82-dallas.jpg)

_Ocean Life_ seems a little misplaced in Dallas, which is a long ways from any ocean. While some walls are hard to find, this one was as easy as they get. It even has a parking lot attached, called the 'whale lot'. After a non-eventful flight from San Jose the wall was only a few minutes away from the airport. There was not much time to linger though as we wanted to get down to San Antonio before nightfall.

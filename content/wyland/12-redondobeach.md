![#31 Redondo Beach](../images/31-redondobeach.jpg)

We had actually seen _Gray Whale Migration_ once before. One of the few walls we were not seeing for the first time but it’s just as impressive the second time around.

Seeing a beautiful wall like this where the owners let so much vegetation cover it up makes me wonder why they wanted it. It would be so easy to keep it clear. This wall contains his first blue whale on a whaling wall. The Chamber of Commerce had planned for the wall to take 12 months but Wyland managed to complete it in just 11 days!

![#73 Chicago](../images/73-chicago.jpg)

We went to spend the weekend in Chicago. It was our first time there and we had a great time. When it came time to look for the _The Windy Whales_ we were not sure what we would find. Wikipedia lists the wall as extinct. We had no trouble finding the Inter-Continental hotel but when we got there we found that they had built an apartment building covering most of it. It’s an odd sight to see a sliver of a mural left exposed like that. It’s such a shame to destroy art like that. Especially in a city where architecture and distinctiveness is such a part of the city.

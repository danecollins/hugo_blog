![Vancouver #8](../images/08_vancouver.jpg)

Another ferry ride, which actually turned out to be more of a bus ride than a ferry ride, from Victoria to Vancouver and we were ready to head to another wall. From the Google street view images I could tell that _Orcas_ was not intact because some housing had been built against it which covered some of it. When we got there we saw that the bottom of the mural was completely gone and only the top part, missing all of the whales, was left. It took some work to figure out how to get a picture of us in front of it but we found a good spot in a parking garage across the street. This garage turns out to be the best location to see the mural from.

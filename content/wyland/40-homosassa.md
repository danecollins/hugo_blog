### In Search of Wyland Walls


![Homosassa Springs #86](../images/86-homosassa.jpg)


_Manatee Sanctuary_ is at the Visitor Center for the Homosassa Springs Wildlife Park. This is right on Hwy 19 and about one mile from the entrance to the Park itself. The wall is outside of the park so you don’t have to pay admission to see it.

After seeing two walls that were more painting than mural it was nice to see a mural again. This one is in the harsh sunlight but is still in good shape. It is somewhat unique as it was done with Guy Harvey as a guest artist.

![New Orleans #69](../images/69-new_orleans.jpg)

_The Blue Whales_ is the last wall in a long driving trip.  We found the wall no problem, but had some trouble trying to find parking as downtown was extremely busy.  We got a photo on our first day and then learned we could actually walk from our hotel so we went back the next day and spent more time enjoying the mural.  The wall is on the side of the Hilton parking lot near the New Orleans Convention Center.  The parking lot is also used for cruise ships leaving via the Mississippi River.  It is a bit faded, but in pretty good shape otherwise.  The wall includes various different animals; I especially liked the manatee and the stingray.

### In Search of Wyland Walls

![Miami #78](../images/78-miami.jpg)

_Florida Marine Life_ was painted in 1998 and it makes me wonder how different the area might have been then.  Today, there is a light rail train that blocks part of the wall and a huge parking garage that makes it difficult to see the wall unless you’re in the garage. It’s possible that when Wyland painted it neither were there but today the wall is difficult to see.

The top floor of the parking garage did give us a good vantage point though and the wall is in good shape with some fading.

This post does not belong in this series as it is not about finding a wall but, for us it is so memorable. Â At an event at the Wyland Gallery in Carmel, we were able to meet Wyland. Even more exciting was watching him paint several different pieces from start to finish. His ability to create stunning images in a short amount of time is truly amazing.

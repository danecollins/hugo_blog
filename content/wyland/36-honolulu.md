![Honolulu #89](../images/89-honolulu.jpg)


I had some concern about finding _Humpback Realm_. It’s listed as being at “Navy Exchange” which make it seem like it was on a military facility but the only Navy Exchange I could find on the internet was a shopping mall. I was a little doubtful that this was what we were looking for; but since that is all I could find, I figured it was worth giving it a try. We were blown away when we walked into the mall and saw this wall, which is simply amazing. There is just no way to capture all of this ceiling mural in a picture but if you’re ever in Honolulu it is a must see.

![#68 Laguna Beach](../images/68-lagunabeach.jpg)

The benefit of heading to Laguna Beach a second time is that we knew exactly where to go. I was worried that it would be hard to get a picture of both us and _Pacific Realm_ since it is on the ceiling but that turned out not to be too hard.

Like all of the walls there is just no way to really do justice to them in pictures as they cover so much area. In the confines of a store it was hard enough just to get a good look at all of it, let alone a good picture.

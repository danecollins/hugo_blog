![Toronto #70](../images/70-toronto.jpg)

_Heavenly Waters_ is a grand wall although somewhat faded.  Since we were in Toronto without a car we had an adventure getting to it but with some walking and the help of the walk-on-walk-off bus we got there. We had a bit of a challenge getting a good picture in the drizzle. On the walk back we dropped in on the NHL Hall of Fame.

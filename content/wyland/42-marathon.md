As I’ve mentioned before, it is hard to understand how Wyland selects the locations for his walls. I think that _Florida’s Radiant Reef_ is my favorite wall to date and it is on the wall of a KMart! This wall has some of everything in it and is in great shape.  It is big and visible from the main road so I’m sure a ton of people get to see it.

Guy Harvey also contributed to this wall.

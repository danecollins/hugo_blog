### In Search of Wyland Walls

![Niagra Falls #81](../images/81-niagarafalls.jpg)

Since we were in Toronto without a car and wanted to see this wall we could either rent a car or take a bus tour.  We chose the latter with hopes that the logistics would work out.  The bus stopped on the Canadian side of Niagara and only for 80 minutes.  Our issue was that the wall is on the US side. A map told us that it was a walk of about a mile but we knew that we would have to go through Customs both ways and we were unsure how long that would take.  It turned out not to be a problem as we cleared Customs in less than a minute in each direction. Sometimes things just go you way and we got a great picture with _Atlantic Humpback Whales_.

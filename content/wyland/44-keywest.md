### In Search of Wyland Walls

Getting to Key West was a scenic drive but took longer than we expected. Finding the wall took a bit more time. There are times when we walk up to walls and are awed by them and times when we walk up and wonder just what the owners are doing.  Unfortunately _Florida’s Living Reef_ was the latter.

Looking at what is left of the wall, you get the feeling that this was a spectacular mural when Wyland painted it but now, as the building is being turned into a brew pub, it’s being chopped up and covered up. The mural covers 3 sides of the building and while one side is mostly intact the front has been significantly modified and covered up by palm trees. What a shame. I’m glad we got to see it when we did.

### In Search of Wyland Walls

![#63 Hollywood](../images/63-hollywood.jpg)

After the disappointment in Santa Monica and Chicago we were looking forward to finding wall that was intact.  On a trip to LA for a wedding, we got there a few hours early which gave us an opportunity to run up to Hollywood. _Life Size Blue Whales_ turned out to be much easier to find being on the wall of one of the building on the outside of the Paramount complex. The complex is bordered by two busy streets, Melrose Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard, but the wall is painted on a building on Gower Street and is probably seen by many fewer people because of it. I’m surprised by the location.

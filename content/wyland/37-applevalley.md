### In Search of Wyland Walls

![Minnesota Zoo #37](../images/71-applevalley.jpg)


Sometimes you find a wall where you don’t expect to see one.  We went to Minneapolis to visit family last week.  When I think of Minnesota, oceans and whales are not the first thing that comes to mind but I figured it would not hurt to check the list of walls and sure enough there was one at the Zoo. It is always much harder to research a wall that is not out in public so you’re never really sure if it is going to be there but we were able to find _Our Ocean Family_ and were surprised by how good a shape it is in.  Even though it’s been there for 16 years it was in great shape.  It was a great addition to our trip.

This wall is directly across the street from the wall in the KMart but definitely does not have the grandeur of _Florida’s Radiant Reef_. It appears that some modifications have taken place to the building the wall is on so that now the wall is in separate sections.  This lead to us only being able to get our picture in front of part of the wall but below are some pictures of other sections of the wall.

This wall was painted in 1990 but retouched in 2000 so it is in great shape.27

I always wonder how Wyland selected the locations for his walls. Some just seem too secluded for how great they are but the _Great Whales of New Bedford_ is not one of those. As you drive in to New Bedford you just can’t miss the walls of the Marine Terminal with whales covering all sides of the building. Given the significance of whales to New Bedford this wall seems so at home here and being one of the newer walls is in such great shape.

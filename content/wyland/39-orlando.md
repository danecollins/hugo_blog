When walls are outdoors I can often use Google Street View to track them down and make sure they are still there but when they are in airports and hotels it is more of a ‘show up and see’ adventure as it was for _First Born_ at the Renaissance. In this case it was right in the hotel lobby and could not have been easier to find. I really like the simplicity of _First Born._ This is a mural that would look wonderful at home.

It has been very interesting to see the difference in size of the each wall.  From the truly gigantic _Planet Ocean_ in Long Beach to the relatively small _Manatees_ at the airport. 

And now, we’re off to the west coast of Florida.

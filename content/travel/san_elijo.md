There are a lot of campgrounds along the southern California coast but many of them are isolated. From San Elijo you can walk to a few restaurants and directly access the walking path. The campground is on a bluff rather than right on the beach but the views are worth it.

The best sites are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 59, 60, 146, 147, 148, 150, 151, 152, 153, 155, 162, 163, 165, 168.

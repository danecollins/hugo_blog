![Red Rock State Park](red_rock_sp.png)

There are parks that are easy to get to and that are in places where you're likely to go so it's easy to drop in on a trip.  This is not one of them. It's East of Bakersfield and North of Lancaster and is really a destination in itself.  If you make the trip though you are rewarded by some geology you don't often get to see.

Cora really enjoyed running around all the rocks.

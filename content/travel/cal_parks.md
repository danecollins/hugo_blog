### A tour of California State Parks

Since we got our class b camper I thought it would be nice to spend more time visiting the 280 California State Parks.  It seems like we have visited many parks but really, we have seen almost none, especially recently.  Two hundred and eighty parks is a lot of parks and, much like visiting Wyland Walls it will lead us to many places we would not visit otherwise.

So far, we have focused on visiting the state beaches on the coast from Santa Cruz to San Francisco.  Most of these are beautiful beaches along the California coast but with little differentiation. Some have trails and some like Garrapata, have a beautiful path along the coast.

Like with Wyland Walls, in the early days of our journey it is easy to visit many parks in a single day.  To date, we have visited 28 parks including:

* Anderson Marsh State Historic Park
* Andrew Molera State Park
* Bean Hollow State Beach
* Clear Lake State Park - The Kelsey Campground is right on the lake.  Overall a great campground.
* Garrapata State Park - This park has one of the most beautiful walking paths of the Big Sur coast.  If you were to walk in only one place on the coast I'd pick this one.
* Half Moon Bay State Beach - Walking distance to downtown and right on the bike trail.
* Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park
* Henry W. Coe State Park
* Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park
* Marina State Beach
* Mendocino Headlands State Park -- This is a great hike around the Mendocino headlands and a must do.
* Monterey State Beach
* Monterey State Historic Park
* Moss Landing State Beach
* Mount Diablo State Park
* Natural Bridges State Beach
* Pescadero State Beach
* Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park -  In the redwoods and right on the river.
* Pismo State Beach
* Pomponio State Beach
* San Gregorio State Beach
* Seacliff State Beach
* Tahoe State Recreation Area - A great place to camp in Lake Tahoe
* The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park - Easy access to beautiful redwoods
* Twin Lakes State Beach
* Van Damme State Park
* Wilder Ranch State Park
* Zmudowski State Beach

As we work to see more parks I'm such many adventures are to come.

![Convict Lake](convict.jpg)
On our way to Mammoth we had not planned to stop at Convict Lake as it is a short drive off the freeway and we has just driven around Crowley Lake, which was unremarkable. As we saw several cars head that way we decided to follow them.  This turned out to be the most crowded place we visited on the trip, so much so that we had to wait for a parking space. The mountains around the lake are striking. We definitely need to go back when it is not so busy.

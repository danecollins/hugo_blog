Just south of Carmel there are many options for viewing the Big Sur coast. My favorite one is at Garrapata State Park. Its coastal trails are easy to access, easy to hike and have great views of the coast. You can also get to the beach where you can see some interesting rock formations in the bluffs.

Nestled just south of the quaint town of Carmel lies a stretch of California's most iconic coastline â€“ Big Sur. While this region is dotted with numerous vantage points and scenic spots, [Garrapata State Park](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=579) stands out as a personal favorite.

One of the highlights of the Eastern Sierras is the June Lake Loop.  A road that does a loop around four different lakes on the western side of 395. While the lakes are all pretty the highlight of the drive was spotting Horsetail Falls on the western end of the loop. Pictures really cannot do justice to the beauty of this waterfall.

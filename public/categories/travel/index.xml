      <description>With the big rainfalls we have had this year we knew that there would be wildflowers. While spending a few days in Paso Robles we thought we would explore a little and ended up heading over to Lake Nacimiento. It was definitely worth the trip as the wild flowers were out in force.&#xA;While the wild flowers were the highlight of the trip on our way back to the freeway I spotted this great folded sandstone which was completely unexpected.</description>

      <description>The waterfall through the basalt cliff is spectacular. We got to see it late in the afternoon and the sun was not at the best angle but this is a place that is worth going to more than once.</description>

      <description>Initially uncertain about what to expect, our visit to the Petrified Forest National Park was a delightful revelation. This expansive park offers more than just a casual glimpse into ancient geology; it provides a captivating landscape filled with petrified wood.&#xA;Why the Petrified Forest is Worth the Visit&#xA;Ample Space to Roam: One of the first things you&amp;rsquo;ll notice is the park&amp;rsquo;s sheer size, allowing you to wander freely and take in the sights of petrified wood scattered all around.</description>

      <description>There are parks that are easy to get to and that are in places where you&amp;rsquo;re likely to go so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to drop in on a trip. This is not one of them. It&amp;rsquo;s East of Bakersfield and North of Lancaster and is really a destination in itself. If you make the trip though you are rewarded by some geology you don&amp;rsquo;t often get to see.&#xA;Cora really enjoyed running around all the rocks.</description>

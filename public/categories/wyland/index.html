    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls Whale Commuters has quite the history in Milwaukee with many residents for it and many against it. In the end, the wall it was on was demolished and just a small part of it was preserved and hung as a picture on the side of a freeway. Of all the walls we&rsquo;ve visited this was the first time I could not figure out how to get a picture of us standing in front of the wall.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls Since we were in Toronto without a car and wanted to see this wall we could either rent a car or take a bus tour. We chose the latter with hopes that the logistics would work out. The bus stopped on the Canadian side of Niagara and only for 80 minutes. Our issue was that the wall is on the US side. A map told us that it was a walk of about a mile but we knew that we would have to go through Customs both ways and we were unsure how long that would take.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls Heavenly Waters is a grand wall although somewhat faded. Since we were in Toronto without a car we had an adventure getting to it but with some walking and the help of the walk-on-walk-off bus we got there. We had a bit of a challenge getting a good picture in the drizzle. On the walk back we dropped in on the NHL Hall of Fame.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls This wall looked great as it has just been repainted, not by Wyland though. The person that did the work did a great job and added some personal touches such as pelicans in the middle of the wall. This was the largest wall we have seen on this trip and was a great way to finish our adventure.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls While in Virginia Beach it was time to make a decision about whether we would continue South, into the aftermath of hurricane Florence, or just call it a successful trip and stay in Virginia Beach until the weekend and just fly home from Norfolk. The weather reports from coastal North Carolina still sounded grim with the water levels still increasing. On the other hand, if we did not go now, it was unclear when we would ever be back to see the walls in Wilmington and Myrtle Beach.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls The wall in Norfolk is in the harbor area. There is a great walkway there that offers a view of the large shipyards across the water and along a World War 2 battleship. The area was pretty quiet with only a few people around. Since it was the convention center area my guess the crowds are based on what is going on at there. “Humpbacks off the Virginia Coast” was easy to find and looks good although part of it is obscured by the construction of the adjacent building.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls It rained quite hard on the way from Baltimore to Washington but by the time we got to the Zoo it had reduced to a drizzle. It was not great Zoo weather and, while not yet lunchtime, the animals has no interest in being out or active. As we usually have a good time at zoos we were a little disappointed but we did get to see “Dolphins-Small Tooth Whales” on the wall of the visitor center.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls Unlike the West coast, on the East coast, you cat get to three states between lunch and dinner. After our success in Wilmington, we headed off to Baltimore to see “Extinct Atlantic Gray Whales” which while not an original Wyland, it has been repainted by someone else, it still retains most of the Wyland charm. It is in a great location across from the football stadium and I’m sure it is seen by a huge number of people as all Wyland wall should.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls After the disappointment of the destruction of “East Coast Humpbacks” in Philadelphia, we were doubly disappointed to find that “Humpbacks off the New Jersey Coast” was in the process of being painted over by someone. Especially as Wyland has been rejuvenating so many walls, to have someone else just painting over one of his walls was a little depressing. Given the current state of the repainting, we probably only missed seeing it by a month or two.</div>

    <div class="content">In Search of Wyland Walls After failed attempts to see a wall in Philadelphia and Wildwood, we finally got to see “Delaware Marine Mammals” in Wilmington. The wall is aged but the only original Wyland wall anywhere around this area. Right as we were finishing our picture the sky opened up and it started pouring rain, so we did not have an opportunity to spend as much time there as we would have liked.</div>
